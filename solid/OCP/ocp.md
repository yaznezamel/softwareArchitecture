PaymentRequest.java
Immutable input: holds amountInCents and PaymentType.
Role: a simple data carrier from the caller to the processor.

PaymentProcessor.java
Takes a Map<PaymentType, PaymentMethod> registry and routes the request to the right strategy.
Role: orchestrator/dispatcher; closed for modificationâ€”no changes when you add new methods.

Main.java
Wires everything: builds the registry, creates PaymentProcessor, and runs a few example payments.
